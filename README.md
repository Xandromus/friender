friender takes users' answers to 10 questions, as well as a name and a link to a photo, and matches that user with the most similar profile in the database (in this case, a JSON that is updated to include each user who fills out the questionnaire).


## Setup and Usage

The friender app can be accessed either through the Heroku deployment above or it can be run locally through Node using the server.js file on Port 3000.


## Concepts Used

- Node and Express servers
- API endpoints
- HTML URL routing
- Node require and module exports


## Technologies Used

- HTML5/CSS3
- BootStrap
- Chosen.js
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Future Development

As friender is essentially a social-networking site, any future development would involve giving it more functionality that you might expect in such an application. Some basic enhancements would include:

1. Validation for image URLs

2. Use of a true database for persistent storage

3. Database queries to see if a user profile already exists

4. The ability to create an account and customize profiles
